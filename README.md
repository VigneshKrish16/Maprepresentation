- **CSS**: Styling of the web components.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for API calls and map rendering.
- **Map Rendering**: Implemented with a JavaScript library like Leaflet.js for interactive map displays.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Access to the internet to fetch data from the mock API.

### Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vijaysuryabaka/MapRepresentation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MapRepresentation
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the website is running, it will automatically fetch the latest location data from the mock API and render it on the map. Users can interact with the map to zoom in/out and explore different regions.

## API Integration

This website is integrated with a mock API that provides JSON-formatted location data. It is expected to return data in the following format:

```json
{
  "latitude": "40.712776",
  "longitude": "-74.005974"
}
```
